# Torrents Searcher

### What is this?
This is just a *for the fun* Python 3 program that I wrote, to search Torrents in multiple well-known Torrents websites.
I take no responsability if this fries your computer, although I'm pretty sure the probability for something like that to happen is very low. 

### How to use
Just ```chmod +x TorrentSearch.py``` 
and then call it like ```./TorrentSearch.py Ghost in the Shell 2017 1080p x265```


### License?
GPLv3 of course.
