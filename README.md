# Torrents Searcher

### What is this?
This is just a *for the fun* Python 3 program that I wrote, to search Torrents in multiple well-known Torrents websites.
I take no responsability if this fries your computer, although I'm pretty sure the probability for something like that to happen is very low. 

### How to use
Clone the repo to a temporary location and install using pip3
Example for installing TorrentSearcher for the user: 
```
git clone https://github.com/ClaymorePT/TorrentSearcher.git 
cd TorrentSearcher
pip3 install . --user
``` 

Then, just call for ```torrent_searcher```
Example: ```torrent_searcher Ghost in the Shell 2017 1080p x265```
